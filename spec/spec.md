## Status of This Document

Identity Hub is a _STRAWMAN_ specification under development within
the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). It incorporates requirements and
learnings from related work of many active industry players into a shared
specification that meets the collective needs of the community.

The specification will be updated to incorporate feedback, from DIF members and 
the wider community, with a reference implementation being developed within DIF 
that exercises the features and requirements defined here. We encourage reviewers 
to submit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identity-hub/issues) 
as the means by which to communicate feedback and contributions.

## Terminology

## Data Structures

::: todo
**Needs Decision**

Considerations:
- Objects accessible to multiple external parties, in multiple overlapping combinations
- Should objects be distributed across separate buckets, a shared tree, or something else?
- What kind of pointers are required, if any?
- Is tombstoning required?
:::


## Sync & Replication

::: todo
IPFS can provide this to some extent, but do we need anything in addition to what native IPFS provides?
:::

## Commit Strategies

### Full Replace

### Delta-based Merge

::: todo
We need to pick a standard delta-based CRDT - which one?

## General Object Format

All objects within an Identity Hub Instance ****MUST**** be constructed using the same 
top-level format, as defined below:

### Secure Wrapper

The identity hub data structure uses DagJOSE as the security wrapper for both signatures and encryption. JOSE is very flexible when it comes to the specific algorithm to use. Furthermore it also supports multiple signatories and multiple recipients when dealing with signed and encrypted data respectively.

#### Signature envelope
Signed objects are encoded using DagJWS, which requires the payload to be encoded as a CID. The payload itself is stored separately using DagCBOR, or some other IPLD codec. The JWS protected header should include a `kid` property with the value being the DIDUrl of the key that signed the JWS.

#### Encryption envelope
Encrypted objects are encoded using DagJWE. In order to properly encrypt data with DagJWE the data needs to bw encoded as an *inline CID* (see details below). JWEs can be used for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, at the wrapper layer we don't make any prescriptions about this. JWEs can also use various different ciphers, we recommend the use of `xchacha20poly1305`, as it is one of the most performant ciphers, and there are multiple implementations.

##### Encoding an *inline CID*
In order to encode an object as an *inline CID* the following algorithm is used:

1. Encode the object using some IPLD codec (e.g., DagCBOR)
2. Encode the IPLD bytes from step 1 as an _"identity multihash"_, which is 
constructed as `<hash multicodec><size><bytes>`, where —
   - `hash multicodec` is `00` for "identity"
   - `size` is the varint bytelength
   - `bytes` is the bytes from step 1
3. Create an *inline CID* using the codec, which is encoded as 
`<multibase prefix><multicodec cidv1><multicodec content type><multihash>`, 
where —
  - `multicodec content type` is the IPLD codec used (e.g., `DagCBOR`)
  - `multihash` is the bytes from step 2


### Payload

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "ProfileWrite", // CollectionsWrite, CollectionsQuery, ActionsWrite, etc.
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Access & Permissions


## Interfaces

### Feature Detection

The Identity Hub specification defines well-recognized Hub configurations to maximize 
interoperability (see Hub Configurations), but implementers may wish to support a custom 
subset of the Interfaces and features. The Feature Detection interface is the means by 
which a Hub expresses support for the Interfaces and features it implements.

#### Object Definition

A compliant Identity Hub Profile interface ****MUST**** produce a Feature Detection object 
defined as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "FeatureDetection",
  "interfaces": { ... }
}
```

All compliant Hubs ****MUST**** respond with a valid Feature Detection object when receiving 
the following request object:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "FeatureDetectionRead"
}
```

##### Properties & Values

The following properties and values are defined for the Feature Detection object:
- The value of the `interfaces` property ****MUST**** be an object, composed of the following 
  optional properties: 
    - The object ****MAY**** contain a `profile` property. If the property is not present, 
    it indicates the Hub implementation does not support any aspects of the interface. If the 
    property is present, its value ****MUST**** be an object that ****MAY**** include any of the 
    following properties, wherein a boolean `true` value indicates support for the interface 
    capability, while a boolean `false` value or omission of the property indicates the interface 
    capability is not supported:
      - `ProfileRead`
      - `ProfileWrite`
      - `ProfileDelete`
    - The object ****MAY**** contain a `collections` property. If the property is not present, 
    it indicates the Hub implementation does not support any aspects of the interface. If the 
    property is present, its value ****MUST**** be an object that ****MAY**** include any of the 
    following properties, wherein a boolean `true` value indicates support for the interface 
    capability, while a boolean `false` value or omission of the property indicates the interface 
    capability is not supported:
      - `CollectionsQuery`
      - `CollectionsWrite`
      - `CollectionsDelete`
    - The object ****MAY**** contain a `actions` property. If the property is not present, 
    it indicates the Hub implementation does not support any aspects of the interface. If the 
    property is present, its value ****MUST**** be an object that ****MAY**** include any of the 
    following properties, wherein a boolean `true` value indicates support for the interface 
    capability, while a boolean `false` value or omission of the property indicates the interface 
    capability is not supported:
      - `ActionsQuery`
      - `ActionsWrite`
      - `ActionsDelete`
    - The object ****MAY**** contain a `permissions` property. If the property is not present, 
    it indicates the Hub implementation does not support any aspects of the interface. If the 
    property is present, its value ****MUST**** be an object that ****MAY**** include any of the 
    following properties, wherein a boolean `true` value indicates support for the interface 
    capability, while a boolean `false` value or omission of the property indicates the interface 
    capability is not supported:
      - `PermissionsRequest`
      - `PermissionsQuery`
      - `PermissionsWrite`
      - `PermissionsDelete`

### Profile

The Profile interface provides a simple mechanism for setting and retrieving a JSON object 
with basic profile information that describes the target DID entity.

#### Object Format

A compliant Identity Hub Profile interface ****MUST**** produce an object of the following 
structure, if a Profile has been established by the controller of a DID:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "Profile",
  "descriptors": [
    {
      "@context": "http://schema.org",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Jeffrey Lebowski",
      "givenName": "Jeffery",
      "middleName": "The Big",
      "familyName": "Lebowski",
      "description": "That's just, like, your opinion, man.",
      "website": "https://ilovebowling.com",
      "email": "jeff@ilovebowling.com",
      "image": IMG_URL,
      "address": {
        "@type": "PostalAddress",
        "streetAddress": "5227 Santa Monica Boulevard",
        "addressLocality": "Los Angeles",
        "addressRegion": "CA"
      }
    },
    {...},
    {...}
  ]
}
```

An object ****MUST**** have one or more descriptors. The first element of the descriptors array is primary, and ****SHOULD**** be used unless another schema in the array is explicitly required.

#### Write

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "ProfileWrite",
  "data": {
    "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
    "@type": "Profile",
    "descriptors": [...]
  }
}
```

### Collections

To maximize decentralized app and service interoperability, the Collections interface of Identity Hubs 
provides a mechanism to store data relative to shared schemas. By storing data in accordance with a 
given schema, which may be well-known in a given vertical or industry, apps and services can leverage 
the same datasets across one another, enabling a cohesive, cross-platform, cross-device, cross-app 
experience for users.

#### Query

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "CollectionsQuery",
  "statements": [
    {
      "uri": "https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Write

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "CollectionsWrite",
  "entries": [
    {
      "create": "https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist",
      "data": {
        // A new entry of the https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist schema
      }
    },
    {
      "modify": "Qm09myn76rvs5e4ce4eb57h5bd6sv55v6e",
      "data": {
        // A delta-based modification targeting an existing object's top-level ID
      }
    },
    {
      "create": "https://schema.org/Event",
      "data": {
        // A new entry of the https://schema.org/Event schema
      }
    },
    {
      "replace": "Qm65765jrn7be64v5q35v6we675br68jr",
      "data": {
        // An entire replacement targeting an existing object's top-level ID
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Delete

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "CollectionsDelete",
  "targets": [
    "https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist",
    "Qm09myn76rvs5e4ce4eb57h5bd6sv55v6e",
    "https://schema.org/Event",
    "Qm65765jrn7be64v5q35v6we675br68jr"
  ]
}
```

### Actions

Actions are notifications that are based on some form of directed action the Sender 
wants to convey to the [[ref:Hub User]]. All Actions ****MUST**** be of a type defined 
under the `schema.org/Action` family of objects.

#### Query

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "ActionsQuery",
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "https://schema.org/LikeAction"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Write

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "ActionsSend",
  "entries": [
    {
      "type": "https://schema.org/LikeAction",
      "data": {
        // A new entry of the https://schema.org/LikeAction schema
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "https://schema.org/FollowAction",
      "data": {
        // A new entry of the https://schema.org/FollowAction schema
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Delete

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "ActionsDelete",
  "targets": [
    "https://schema.org/ReadAction",
    "https://schema.org/BefriendAction",
    "Qmf9w548h8sc54p3584h6ow45aa56fvs5",
    "Qm65765jrn7be64v5q35v6we675br68jr"
  ]
}
```

### Permissions

The Permissions interface provides a mechanism for external entities to request access 
to a Hub User's non-public data.

#### Request

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "PermissionRequest",
  "entries": [
    {
      "type": "https://schema.org/MusicPlaylist",
      "tags": ["classic rock", "rock", "rock and roll"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Qm09myn76rvs5e4ce4eb57h5bd6sv55v6e",
    },
    {
      "type": "https://schema.org/Event",
      "tags": ["concerts"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Qm65765jrn7be64v5q35v6we675br68jr",
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hub Configurations

While it is strongly encouraged to implement the full set of Identity Hub features and Interfaces, not all devices and providers may be capable of doing so. To allow for maximum reach and proliferation in the ecosystem, the following are well-recognized configurations of Identity Hub feature sets that tend to serve different purposes.

### Open Data Publication

This Hub configuration is ideal for implementers who seek to expose intentionally public data via the Identity Hub semantic data discovery Interfaces. This implementation is lightweight does not require the implementer to support any of the authentication, permissioning, or ingest mechanisms that other features and Interfaces do.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://identity.foundation/schemas/hub",
  "@type": "FeatureDetection",
  "interfaces": {
    "profile": {
      "ProfileRead": true
    },
    "collections": {
      "CollectionsQuery": true
    }
  }
}
```
